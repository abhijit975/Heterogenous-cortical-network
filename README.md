# Heterogenous-cortical-network
This is based on my project on firing statistics of heterogenous cluster sizes in cortical networks.
Written in C++ (also works with C).

This project has 4 main C++/C codes:
1. homegeneous.cpp - Produces datafile for plotting a raster plot with homogeneous cluster sizes.
2. balanced_heterogeneous.cpp - Produces firing statistics for perfectly balanced network with heterogeneous cluster sizes.
3. partial_balance.cpp - Produces partially balanced network and its firing statistics.
4. hierarchy.cpp - Produces a partially balanced network with hierarchy.
